# State Management in React

A state helps a component remember and display information and change overtime.

- **State in React**: The `useState` hook in React allows components to store and manage data that may change over time. This is achieved using the syntax `[initialState, futureState] = useState(state)`.

## State Management Strategies

- **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders**: To prevent the entire page from re-rendering due to minor changes in a child component, it is recommended to define the state in the lowest common ancestor component. This strategy ensures that only the components that use the state are re-rendered, improving performance.
- **State Management**: React provides several state management libraries and patterns, such as Redux, Context API, and Zustand, to manage state across components. These libraries help in organizing and sharing state between components, making it easier to manage complex applications.

## Re-rendering in React

- **Re-rendering**: When a component's state changes, React re-renders the component and its children. This process is known as re-rendering.

- To minimize re-renders, we can push down the state to the child component rather than the parent component. This is because when the state is in the parent component, it causes a re-render of all child components.

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }``

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Clicked {count} times</button>;
}
```

- There are two buttons here, each has its own state, and they update independently.
- When the button is clicked, the count is incremented by 1.
- The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable `count` and a function `setCount` to update it.
- The `useState` hook returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.
- The `useState` hook is called inside the component function.
- The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable `count` and a function `setCount` to update it.
- The `useState` hook returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.
- The `useState` hook is called inside the component function.
- To update the state of both the buttons, we need to lift the state up to the parent component.

- In React the data is shared between components, from the parent to the child component.

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
