# Custom Hooks

## 1. Side-Effects

- In React, a side effect is any action that affects something outside the scope of the component's rendering process. These actions typically involve interacting with the external world.

## 2. Hooks

- Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
