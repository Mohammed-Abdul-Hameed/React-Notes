# Conditional Rendering

- Conditional rendering is a feature in React that allows you to render different UI elements based on certain conditions.
- It is useful when you want to show or hide components based on the state of your application.
- It is also useful when you want to render different components based on the props passed to them.

- Here are the few ways to implement conditional rendering in React
1. `If-Else` statement
2. Ternary Operator: `condition ? true : false`
3. Logical Operators: `&&` , `||`
